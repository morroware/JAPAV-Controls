## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. Device Setup
Edit `transmitters.txt` to define each device's IP and name. Format:
```
Device Name, http://device-ip-address
```

### 2. IR Commands
Define each command in `payloads.txt` with a format of `command_name=ir_code`. Example:
```
power=sendir,1:1,1,38000,1,1,192,192,48,145...
volume_up=sendir,1:1,1,38000,1,1,193...
volume_down=0000 0048 0000 0018 00c1...
```

### 3. System Settings
Settings can be managed through `settings.php`, including:
- Device configurations
- Volume limits and steps
- Network API timeouts
- Logging level and options

## üíª Usage

1. **Access Control Panel**: Open `index.php` to access the main AV control panel.
2. **Device Controls**: Use the intuitive UI to control power, volume, and input sources.
3. **IR Remote Controls**: Manage compatible devices (e.g., cable boxes) with on-screen controls.
4. **Configuration Panel**: Update settings through `settings.php`.

### Receiver Control Features
- **Power Controls**: Toggle power for individual or grouped receivers.
- **Channel Selection**: Select channels from a list of configured transmitters.
- **Volume Adjustment**: Adjust volume with customizable steps and limits.

## üîÑ API Endpoints

### Device Control
Send POST requests to control device actions.

#### Power Commands
```php
POST /api.php
{
    "device_url": "http://device-ip",
    "action": "power_on" // or "power_off"
}
```

#### Volume Control
```php
POST /api.php
{
    "receiver_ip": "device-ip",
    "volume": 50 // volume level
}
```

#### IR Command
```php
POST /api.php
{
    "device_url": "http://device-ip",
    "action": "volume_up" // or any other IR command defined in payloads.txt
}
```

## üîê Security Recommendations

- **Restrict IP Access**: Limit access to trusted networks or specific IPs.
- **Use VLAN Segmentation**: Separate AV device network from general use networks.
- **Secure Config Files**: Ensure permissions for `config.php` are set to 640 or lower.
- **Log Monitoring**: Regularly review logs stored in `av_controls.log` to monitor activity and troubleshoot issues.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Device Not Responding**
   - Check the network connection and IP address configuration in `transmitters.txt`.
   - Verify device power status.

2. **IR Command Issues**
   - Double-check command definitions in `payloads.txt`.
   - Ensure IR transmitter setup is correct and operational.

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Confirm correct permissions for `config.php` and log files.

4. **API Connection Errors**
   - Review network settings and verify API endpoint availability on each device.

### Log File
Logs are saved in `av_controls.log` with timestamps, error levels, and messages.

---

## üíª Development

### Requirements
- **PHP 7.4+**
- **Modern Browser** for testing
- **Network Access** to AV devices

### Code Standards
- Follows **PSR-12** for PHP code.
- Use **consistent documentation** and error handling practices.
- Prioritize **security** and **performance** in all code.

### Development Setup
Clone the repository, then:
```bash
composer install
cp config.example.php config.php
```
